# Blood-Data-analysis
As part of a study project on Machine Learning Techniques for Fluid Mechanics, Autumn '21


The data-set which I worked on has information all about different attributes related blood like 'wall shear strength', 'average blood pressure' and various other important 
attributes that help us decide the health of femoral arteries and evaluate the future heart risk.

The data was collected through collborating with various local hospitals.
To have a rough idea about the data take a look at the foolowing snapshot of the first few rows.

Since wall shear stress is an important factor in detecting flaws in arterial flow,
the given data was made to fit into a linear regression model to make a few
predictions based on a dependent variable taken. For an instance, consider heart
rate to be the independent variable. Discarding other variables, a part of the data
that was made to fit to a linear regression model is as shown.
